## 🚀 Problem Statement
E-commerce sellers, D2C brands, and small-to-medium logistics teams face significant inefficiencies in selecting the most cost-effective and reliable courier service for each shipment.

Currently, businesses rely on multiple courier partners (typically 5–10 providers such as Delhivery, Blue Dart, DTDC, etc.), each offering different pricing structures, delivery timelines, and service quality. However, there is no unified platform that provides real-time, standardized comparison across these courier services.

### Key Challenges:
1. **Time-Consuming Manual Process:** Sellers spend significant time comparing courier rates for each shipment.
2. **Complex Pricing Structures:** Multiple variables (zone, weight, volumetric weight, surcharges) make accurate calculation difficult.
3. **Lack of Real-Time Aggregation:** No centralized system to fetch and compare live courier rates.
4. **Suboptimal Decision-Making:** Sellers often choose non-optimal couriers, leading to higher shipping costs or delays.
5. **High Operational Costs:** Inefficient courier selection results in increased logistics expenses.
6. **Poor Scalability:** Manual workflows do not scale with increasing order volumes.
7. **Limited Data Insights:** Sellers lack visibility into courier performance, cost trends, and optimization opportunities.
